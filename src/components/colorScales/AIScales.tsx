            <h2>AI Collaboration</h2>
            <p>I used AI as a <strong>strategic partner</strong>. Sometimes it built full features, sometimes we collaborated, sometimes it helped
               me ideate, and other times I coded entirely by hand. My engineering background helped choose the right tool at the right
               time.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Claude Code:</strong> Feature building, test suite generation, refactoring, code collaboration
                </li>
                <li><strong>Junie (JetBrains):</strong> Quick technical Q&A</li>
                <li><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Strategy validation, idea exploration, structural improvements</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Manual Coding:</strong> Validate AI outputs; UI, business logic, styling and features where precision mattered most
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This mix reduced development time by ~40â€“50% while I retained ownership of product vision, UI, and quality.</p>
