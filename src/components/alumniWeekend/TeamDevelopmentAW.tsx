            <p>Having efficient workflows allowed me to find opportunities to build my team’s skills:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Paired senior and junior designers in a <strong>peer mentorship loop</strong>, boosting confidence and expanding my creative capacity
                </li>
                <li>A junior designer strengthened their typography skills by owning all editorial work. With support, they balanced experimentation and execution</li>
                <li>A senior designer interested in motion, led <strong>motion graphics and projection design</strong> for brand assets and for the closing event—broadening our creative toolkit while delivering new value to stakeholders
                </li>
                <li>Paired junior designer with social media manager, empowering them to ideate independently and present their best concepts to the team</li>
            </ul>
        </>
