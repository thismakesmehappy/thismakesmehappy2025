            <h2>Continuous Improvement</h2>
            <p>When I joined Drexel five years prior, signature events were fragmented: designed in silos, inconsistent in style, and generic in messaging.</p>
            <p>I introduced three systematic changes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Treat events as <strong>branding problems</strong> with consistent messaging across touchpoints</li>
                <li><strong>Front-load creative exploration</strong> to secure partner buy-in early</li>
                <li>Center alumni representation to foster connection and engagement</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                At first, both Marcomm and Alumni Relations resisted. I focused on what I could controlâ€”developing
                strong visual concepts, codifying key art, and empowering my team with reusable systems.
            </p>
        </>
