            <p>Systematic collaboration ensured consistency across every medium.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Within Marcomm:</strong> we iterated visuals, copy, digital strategy, and operations.
                </li>
                <li><strong>With Alumni:</strong> we cross-pollinated programming and messaging.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Even small details reinforced the experience. <strong>Whether alumni opened an invitation at home, drank from a customized beer cup, navigated campus signage, or took a selfie in front of a step-and-repeat, they encountered a unified brand.</strong>
