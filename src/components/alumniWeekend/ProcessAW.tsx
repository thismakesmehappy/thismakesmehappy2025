            <h2>The Process</h2>
            <p>We followed our now tried-and-true process of collaboration and front-loading creative development.</p>
            <p>Before any creative work, Marcomm and Alumni aligned on shared goals:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maximize attendance for the signature event</li>
                <li>Welcome alumni back with a sense of belonging</li>
                <li>Celebrate reunions and campus pride</li>
                <li>Demonstrate the ongoing value of on-campus programming</li>
            </ul>
            <p>With clear goals, the Marcomm team ideated and brainstormed multiple ideas.
               We ideated content, visuals and tactics, then narrowed down to two main concepts.
               We presented to our partners, and with their selection and feedback, we finalized the concept
               and developed key art to facilitate the rest of the creative process.
            </p>
        </>
