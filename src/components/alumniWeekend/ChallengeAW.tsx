            <h2>Challenge and Strategic Context</h2>

            <p>Alumni Weekend 2022 posed an opportunity to re-engage alumni after two years away from on-campus events. The creative challenge was to spark excitement and belonging, and to motivate alumni to return in person.</p>
            <p>Events ranged from intimate, 20-person reunions to a 400+ person, campus-wide celebration </p>

            <p>This required a <strong>brand system designed like a product </strong>: adaptable across user contexts, consistent in message, and efficient to execute.
            </p>
        </>);
